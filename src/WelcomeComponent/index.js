          Climate change is an urgent threat brought about by carbon emissions
          from the combustion of oil and gas. The carbon footprint of an average
          American is 16 tons per year, as compared to 6 tons per year in the UK
          and 2 tons in India.

          Buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of emissions. The
          carbon footprint for an average single-family home is 5 tons per year.
          As a homeowner, you can take action to reduce your carbon footprint.
          In many states, the supply of electricity is on track to be 100%
          renewable. That means when you change your equipment and appliances in
          your home to run on electricity, you are reducing your carbon
          footprint. The science of climate change requires zero emissions, and
          all the tools required to achieve zero emissions in houses exist
          today.
